### Part1
We ask for the user's name and age in our program. If his or her age is over or equal to 18, our program will output that the user is already an adult. If he or she is still under 18, the program will calculate when the user will get 18 and print the year as an output. Our program can serve as a Calculator Plugin for websites and software.

### Why we went with GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 and Microsoft Community Code of Conduct as the license and code of conduct respectively? 
- As our open-source license, we picked the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3 because it allows users to study, utilize, combine, share, and redistribute our software component while still safeguarding our copyright. 
- Since it meets our aims of building a safe, inviting, inclusive, and helpful community, we picked the Microsoft Community Code of Conduct as our code of conduct.
